    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Chocolate Mousse is the perfect combination of chocolate and sweet dreams.</p>
    <p>With French roots, this dessert is light enough to enjoy for breakfast with fruit or as a clean dessert.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 1/2 Ounces Dark Chocolate</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>2 Large Egg Yolks</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon White Sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Water</li>
        <li>1 Tiny Pinch Salt</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Chilled Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Break up or chop chocolate into small pieces and set aside with butter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add egg yolks, sugar, water, and salt to a metal mixing bowl. Cook, 
            whisking, directly over medium-low heat until the mixture is thick, foamy, 
            and hot to the touch (145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 65 degrees C)). 
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the yolk mixture is thick and hot, add chocolate and butter, and 
            whisk until all chocolate is melted. Let rest for a few minutes on the 
            counter, whisking occasionally to further cool the mixture to just above 
            or at room temperature. The chocolate mixture shouldnâ€™t go into the whipped 
            cream while still warm, but if cooled too long, the mixture may get too 
            firm to fold in.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk cold cream until medium stiff peaks form. If cream is whisked further, 
            it will separate and the final texture will be grainy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer about 1/3 of chocolate mixture into whipped cream, and fold with a 
            spatula until almost incorporated. Gently fold in remaining chocolate, 
            trying to keep as much air in the mixture as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer into 4 serving dishes, wrap, and chill before serving, at least 1 hour.
        </li>
    </ol>
