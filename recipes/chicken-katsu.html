        <li>1 Egg, Beaten</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons All-Purpose Flour</li>

            Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. 
            Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. 
            Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, 
            and then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.
