        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Crepes are a French breakfast staple, dating back to the 13th century.</p>
        <p>With both sweet and savory options crepes are for anyone to enjoy*.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 Cup Milk</li>
            <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup Water</li>
            <li>1 Cup All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/4 Teaspoon Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk eggs, milk, water, and salt together in a large mixing bowl; 
                add flour and butter and whisk vigorously until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. 
                Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup 
                for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter 
                coats the surface evenly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has 
                turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of 
                the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has 
                turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.
            </li>
        </ol>
